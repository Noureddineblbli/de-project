# Name of our GitHub Actions workflow
name: Python Linter

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "lint"
  lint:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a Python environment for use in actions
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      # Step 3: Install our linter dependency
      - name: Install flake8
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flake8
      
      # Step 4: Run the flake8 linter
      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
          flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
